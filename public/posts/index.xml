      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in January I made a &lt;a href=&#34;http://federama.dev/posts/2023-01-18-nvim-setup/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on how I was learning and configuring vim and neovim. After 10 months, during which I focused on University and didn&amp;rsquo;t write code 24/7, I found myself more and more going back to VSCode. So I decided to fine-tune VSCode to my likings, and simplify nvim to use it when I need to modify some files from the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, I realized that in my 4 years of using VSCode I never customized it (aside changing theme) and I filled it with a lot of bloat. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how I simplified and tuned both VSCode and nvim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first blog post I want to document my journey learning vim and nvim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://federama.dev/vim-nvim.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;nvim-nvim&#34; title=&#34;{width=&#39;50%&#39;}&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of its steep learning curve, I have never really considered it. But after watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen&#34;&gt;The Primeagen&lt;/a&gt; flying through the terminal with nvim, I decided to give it a try. I followed some of his videos to learn about vim motions and &lt;a href=&#34;tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to configure nvim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-attempt&#34;&gt;First attempt&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This journey started on my 23rd birthday, seeing a vim motions video explaining how vim works. Then, I started browsing some of the files with vim on my computer to see if the various commands where as difficult as it seemed from the outside. Sure enough, I found the vim concept quite clever and useful: having two modes, one for inserting and one for commands and browsing, is in fact quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
